						<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

						<p>
							This course is based primarily around a semester-long team design project,
							beginning with an idea and a problem statement, and through design research
							and ideation, transforming the problem into a digital prototype. The prompt
							for the project was to consider the ways that technology might be used to
							strengthen our social fabric, where social fabric is a metaphor for how individuals
							interact with each other within a community.
						</p>
				</div>

				<div class="swift-problem">
    				<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>

    				<p>
							The Department of Motor Vehicles visitors need an improved way to gain access
							to wait times and pre-register for specific actions so they feel less anxious
							about spending unnecessary hours at the DMV. The current DMV system is incredibly
							inefficient. With extremely long, inconsistent wait times, it is very inconvenient
							to go to the DMV, as it interrupts people’s schedules and routines.
						</p>

				    <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>

				    <p>My team and I looked at existing systems within the context of the DMV and articulated what their deficiencies are in respect to supporting our target activity of visiting the DMV. We found that the only direct competitors to our application would be online DMV websites that only some states have. Some analogous competitors are the apps Resy and OpenTable. They both directly display how long users will have to wait for a reservation and have a quick call to action for booking tables, thus they effectively match user expectations.</p>

				      <br><br><b>Key findings from competitive analysis:</b>
				      <ol>
				        <li>Our app will serve as a universal platform that will enable users to schedule appointments for a variety of services.</li>
				        <li>The app will enable users to book day-of/walk-in appointments.</li>
				        <li>The app will use real-time data to provide users with approximate and updated wait times, as well as what number in line they are for the service they made an appointment for.</li>
				        <li>The app will potentially enable users to scan and upload necessary documents to minimize time spent at the DMV, depending on government rules and regulations.</li>
				        <li>The app will contain an FAQ page, as well as a chatbox to serve as an outlet for visitors to provide feedback/updates, as well as to easily access FAQs when making appointments.</li>
				      </ol>

				</div>

				<div class="swift-personas">

			    <h3>PERSONAS &amp; SCENARIOS</h3>

			    <p>We created personas, as well as scenarios, to tell a story for a variety of diverse potential users to better understand their needs. These personas evoked empathy for our users to understand their thoughts, goals and frustrations. Scenarios helped us to think in depth about how the interaction/user flow of the app will work. As a result, we were able to grasp the different ways the app could be implemented as well as incorporate new features that we did not necessarily consider at the beginning of the design process.</p>

				<div class="swift-sketches">

				    <h3>SKETCHES &amp; STORYBOARDS</h3>

				    <p>In creating sketches and storyboards, our team was able to produce a visual narrative of our scenarios. Below are examples of the sketches and storyboards.

				    <br>Sketches:</p>

				    <img src = "images/sketch.jpg" alt="sketches" class="thumb"/>

				    <p>Storyboards:</p>

				    <img src = "images/storyboardone.jpg" alt="storyboardone"/>
				    <img src = "images/storyboardtwo.jpg" alt="storyboardtwo"/>
				</div>

				<div class="swift-userflow">

				    <h3>USER FLOW DIAGRAM &amp; WIREFRAMES</h3>

				    <p>My team and I created a User Flow Diagram to clearly display the various interactions we plan to incorporate in our app.

				    <br>User Flow Diagram:</p>

				    <img src = "images/dmv_user_flow.png" alt="userflow" id="userflow"/>

				    <p>Once we understood the different interactions on our app, we sketched the most basic version of the pages of the app. Below are the wireframe sketches.</p>
				    <p>Wireframes Sketch:</p>

				    <img src = "images/paper_prototype_sketched.jpg" alt="paperprototypeone"/>

				    <p>After sketching the wireframes by hand, we used Sketch to create a digital version of the wireframes.</p>
				    <p>Final Wireframe:</p>

				    <img src = "images/final_paper.jpg" alt="finalpaperprototype"/>
				</div>

				<div class="swift-prototype">

				    <h3>PAPER PROTOTYPE</h3>

				    <p>Our team created two versions of a paper prototype of our project solution that focused on tasks and interactions from the scenarios and storyboards we previously developed. After the first prototype, we conducted user tests and received valuable user feedback that we incorporated into our final paper prototype.</p>

				    <p>Changes made:</p>
				      <ol>
				        <li>Option for users to continue as a guest rather than requiring users to create accounts.</li>
				        <li>Option for users to scan and upload necessary documents.</li>
				        <li>Made the “Location” page more user-friendly, as users indicated this page was unclear and confusing.</li>
				        <li>Added “back” buttons to all pages, as well as “confirm” to relevant pages.</li>
				        <li>Changed “Check in” to “Walk in” appointments when scheduling day-of appointments.</li>
				      </ol>


				</div>

				<div class="swift-prototype">

				    <h3>DIGITAL PROTOTYPES &amp; ITERATIONS</h3>
				    <p>Our team used Sketch and Figma to construct our digital prototype. We utilized the feedback we received on our paper prototype to iterate and create the first version of our digital prototype. After creating the first version of the digital prototype, we again conducted user testing to receive feedback and made necessary changes.</p>

				    <p>Changes made:</p>
				      <ol>
				        <li>Created and added a logo to the app.</li>
				        <li>Added more padding to the buttons, which serves as a buffer and provides users with more room for error.</li>
				        <li>Made drop-down menus entirely clickable rather than only the actual arrow clickable, which allows users to more easily click and move on.</li>
				        <li>Added a “help” button on each page in the event that users need assistance.</li>
				        <li>Created a progress indicator for users to see exactly where they are on the app.</li>
				      </ol>

				    <p>Check out the video below to see the final version!</p>

				<div class="swift-takeaways">

				    <h3>TAKEAWAYS &amp; FUTURE ACTION</h3>
				    <p>As this project was part of a semester-long course, there were definitely time constraints. If the project were to be recreated, it would have been beneficial to have more time to create the prototypes. Nonetheless, the interactive design process my team followed was highly enlightening and beneficial. From the ideation and problem definition stages to creating a tangible prototype, my team and I were able to find a gap in the market and identify users’ needs. Therefore, I believe that there is a true need for such an app, and consequently, in the future, my team and I plan to reach out to various states as next steps to actually implement the app.</p>
