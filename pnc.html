    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

		<p>During this summer internship, I worked on Scrum and Kanban Agile teams for two internal technology-related applications, where I participated in requirement gathering sessions, documented requirements, collaborated with business units, developers, and product owners. In addition, I worked on a Capstone Project with four other tech interns, where we were to propose a solution to a current issue occurring within the company. Both my day-to-day work, as well as my Capstone Project, revolved around data, which taught me to be more methodical and meticulous, as one small mistake could affect the entire dataset and have serious consequences. This experience not only taught me technical skills, but I also learned about personal interaction. Everything I worked on was collaborative and in a team setting, as the company emphasized an agile environment. As a result, I have developed a passion for working at the intersection of technology, data, and people.</p>

    <h3>CAPSTONE PROJECT</h3>

    <p>My team was assigned the topic of Alternate Work Areas (AWA), which falls under Business Continuity Management, for when primary work locations are unavailable. I analyzed the current conditions and processes using Excel data and Tableau. I presented our recommendations along with my team to PNC executives, where we proposed creating more AWA space in PNC-owned buildings, not renewing an expiring IBM contract, and utilizing Tableau to keep data better organized and up-to-date. Please contact me if you’d like to hear more about this project!</p>

    <h3>VENTURE VAULT COMPETITION</h3>

    <p>PNC’s “Shark Tank”-like competition where my team and I pitched a business idea focused on a specific customer segment that we found lacked proper resources, tools, and knowledge. I conducted market research, competitive analysis, and website prototyping as part of the competition.
    Unfortunately, I am not allowed to post more about this project, but if you’d like to hear more about it, please contact me!</p>
